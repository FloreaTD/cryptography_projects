# Cryptography Projects
This repository is dedicated to various cryptography implementations, currently featuring Caesar, Playfair, and Vigenère algorithms. Future additions will expand our encryption methods library.

# Features
- Caesar Cipher: Encrypt and decrypt texts using the Caesar cipher method. It also includes a function to brute-force decrypt, generating all possible solutions.
- Vigenère Cipher: Implements encryption and decryption using the Vigenère cipher technique.
- Playfair Cipher: A module for encrypting and decrypting texts with the Playfair cipher algorithm.

# Upcoming
Stay tuned for more cryptography methods being added.

# Usage
Each folder contains a separate project for the respective encryption/decryption algorithms, including detailed instructions on how to use them.
